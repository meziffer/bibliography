Andersen               et al.               report measurements of electron transport in ultraclean graphene devices where the electron drift velocity is extremely high. They found that direct current at high drift velocities generates a large increase in the noise at gigahertz frequencies and that the noise grows exponentially in the direction of the current. The authors attribute the emission mechanism to amplification of acoustic phonons through the Cerenkov effect.                                         Science               , this issue p.               154                        ,              A dc drive current in graphene is used to generate terahertz acoustic waves.           ,              Understanding and controlling nonequilibrium electronic phenomena is an outstanding challenge in science and engineering. By electrically driving ultraclean graphene devices out of equilibrium, we observe an instability that is manifested as substantially enhanced current fluctuations and suppressed conductivity at microwave frequencies. Spatial mapping of the nonequilibrium current fluctuations using nanoscale magnetic field sensors reveals that the fluctuations grow exponentially along the direction of carrier flow. Our observations, including the dependence on density and temperature, are consistently explained by the emergence of an electron-phonon Cerenkov instability at supersonic drift velocities. These results offer the opportunity for tunable terahertz generation and active phononic devices based on two-dimensional materials.},

Despite the conceptual simplicity of this approach, it quickly becomes intractable as the system size grows. An alternate approach is to think of the many-body dynamics as generating noise, which can be measured by the decoherence of a probe qubit. Here we investigate what the decoherence dynamics of such a probe tells us about the many-body system. In particular, we utilize optically addressable probe spins to experimentally characterize both static and dynamical properties of strongly interacting magnetic dipoles. Our experimental platform consists of two types of spin defects in nitrogen delta-doped diamond: nitrogen-vacancy colour centres, which we use as probe spins, and a many-body ensemble of substitutional nitrogen impurities. We demonstrate that the many-body system's dimensionality, dynamics and disorder are naturally encoded in the probe spins' decoherence profile. Furthermore, we obtain direct control over the spectral properties of the many-body system, with potential applications in quantum sensing and simulation.},

Du               et al.               came up with a method involving diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, which can act like tiny, very sensitive magnetometers. The authors placed diamond nanobeams containing the NV centers in close proximity to the sample. This allowed them to measure the spin chemical potential of spin waves---so-called magnons---with nanometer resolution in the material yttrium iron garnet. Because NV centers are also sensitive to temperature, the method may be of use in spin caloritronics.                                         Science               , this issue p.               195                        ,              Nanometer spatial resolution measurement is achieved using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.           ,              The spin chemical potential characterizes the tendency of spins to diffuse. Probing this quantity could provide insight into materials such as magnetic insulators and spin liquids and aid optimization of spintronic devices. Here we introduce single-spin magnetometry as a generic platform for nonperturbative, nanoscale characterization of spin chemical potentials. We experimentally realize this platform using diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers and use it to investigate magnons in a magnetic insulator, finding that the magnon chemical potential can be controlled by driving the system's ferromagnetic resonance. We introduce a symmetry-based two-fluid theory describing the underlying magnon processes, measure the local thermomagnonic torque, and illustrate the detection sensitivity using electrically controlled spin injection. Our results pave the way for nanoscale control and imaging of spin transport in mesoscopic systems.},

A major challenge for its application in the research on two-dimensional (2D) magnets is the positioning of the NV centers at a well-defined, nanoscale distance to the target material required for detecting the small magnetic fields generated by magnetic monolayers. Here, we develop a diamond ``dry-transfer'' technique akin to the state-of-the-art 2D-materials assembly methods and use it to place a diamond micro-membrane in direct contact with the 2D interlayer antiferromagnet CrSBr. We harness the resulting NV-sample proximity to spatially resolve the magnetic stray fields generated by the CrSBr, present only where the CrSBr thickness changes by an odd number of layers. From the magnetic stray field of a single uncompensated ferromagnetic layer in the CrSBr, we extract a monolayer magnetization of               M               CSB               \,=\,0.46(2) T, without the need for exfoliation of monolayer crystals or applying large external magnetic fields. The ability to deterministically place NV-ensemble sensors into contact with target materials and detect ferromagnetic monolayer magnetizations paves the way for quantitative analysis of a wide range of 2D magnets assembled on arbitrary target substrates.},

Hsieh               et al.               , Lesik               et al.               , and Yip               et al.               developed monitoring techniques based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The NV centers can act as sensors because their energy levels and the associated spectra are sensitive to strain and magnetic fields. This enabled optical readout of a spatially resolved signal.                                         Science               , this issue p.               1349               , p.               1359               , p.               1355               ; see also p.               1312                        ,              Nitrogen-vacancy centers are used as sensors inside a high-pressure diamond anvil cell.           ,                             Pressure alters the physical, chemical, and electronic properties of matter. The diamond anvil cell enables tabletop experiments to investigate a diverse landscape of high-pressure phenomena. Here, we introduce and use a nanoscale sensing platform that integrates nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers directly into the culet of diamond anvils. We demonstrate the versatility of this platform by performing diffraction-limited imaging of both stress fields and magnetism as a function of pressure and temperature. We quantify all normal and shear stress components and demonstrate vector magnetic field imaging, enabling measurement of the pressure-driven                                                                        {$\alpha$}                     {$\leftrightarrow$}                     {$\epsilon$}                                                                  phase transition in iron and the complex pressure-temperature phase diagram of gadolinium. A complementary NV-sensing modality using noise spectroscopy enables the characterization of phase transitions even in the absence of static magnetic signatures.},

Nanoscale imaging of moir\'e magnets is highly desirable and serves as a prerequisite to investigate a broad range of intriguing physics underlying the interplay between topology, electronic correlations, and unconventional nanomagnetism. Here we report spin defect-based wide-field imaging of magnetic domains and spin fluctuations in twisted double trilayer (tDT) chromium triiodide CrI               3               . We explicitly show that intrinsic moir\'e domains of opposite magnetizations appear over arrays of moir\'e supercells in low-twist-angle tDT CrI               3               . In contrast, spin fluctuations measured in tDT CrI               3               manifest little spatial variations on the same mesoscopic length scale due to the dominant driving force of intralayer exchange interaction. Our results enrich the current understanding of exotic magnetic phases sustained by moir\'e magnetism and highlight the opportunities provided by quantum spin sensors in probing microscopic spin related phenomena on two-dimensional flatland.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. Yet, it remains experimentally challenging to investigate such dynamics with high spectroscopic resolution in both frequency and momentum space, particularly in two-dimensional correlated systems. Here, we leverage Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a powerful and non-invasive tool to study thin-film Bi\$\_2\$Sr\$\_2\$CaCu\$\_2\$O\$\_\textbraceleft 8+{$\delta$}\textbraceright\$ (BSCCO), revealing several distinct dynamical phenomena across the superconducting phase diagram. At zero magnetic field and low temperatures, NV depolarization (\$T\_1\$) noise spectroscopy captures the low-frequency (GHz-scale) magnetic noise generated by nodal superconducting quasiparticle excitations, in agreement with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field theory. Near the critical temperature \$T\_c \textbackslash approx 90\$ K, supercurrent-fluctuation-induced noise leads to a sharp reduction of the NV \$T\_1\$. By carefully analyzing the temperature-scaling of \$T\_1\$, we observe clear deviations from the BCS prediction, reflecting the importance of order parameter fluctuations and enabling the determination of both static and dynamical critical exponents. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of NV \$T\_1\$ near \$T\_c\$; the field-induced smearing of the transition unveils the presence of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, NV decoherence (\$T\_2\$) noise spectroscopy allows us to characterize magnetic noise at even lower MHz-scale frequencies and obtain evidence for complex vortex-solid fluctuations well below \$T\_c\$. Our results establish quantum noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.},

Here, we report on its detailed magnetic and structural characteristics. We evidence that it undergoes a transition to an A-type antiferromagnetic state below               T               N               \,{$\approx$}\,140\,K with a pronounced two-dimensional character, preceded by ferromagnetic correlations within the monolayers. Furthermore, we unravel the low-temperature hidden-order within the long-range magnetically-ordered state. We find that it is associated to a slowing down of the magnetic fluctuations, accompanied by a continuous reorientation of the internal field. These take place upon cooling below               T               s               \,{$\approx$}\,100\,K, until a spin freezing process occurs at               T               *\,{$\approx$}\,40\,K. We argue this complex behavior to reflect a crossover driven by the in-plane uniaxial anisotropy, which is ultimately caused by its mixed-anion character.

The Raman selection rules are determined by both the crystal symmetry and magnetic order while the magnon energy is determined by different interaction terms. Using non-interacting spin-wave theory, we extract the spin-wave gap at zero magnetic field, an anisotropy energy, and interlayer exchange in bilayers. We also find magnetic fluctuations increase with reduced thickness, which may contribute to a less robust magnetic order in single layers.},

A pierced atomic force microscope (AFM) tip is developed as a nanoaperture to implant single ions with nanometer resolution at kinetic energies below 10\,keV to avoid ion straggling. This technique is already used for a large number of novel quantum devices in diamonds. However, to further improve the resolution, scattering at the aperture is identified as the main limiting factor of lateral placement accuracy and ion channeling effect as the main factor for depth resolution at low kinetic energy. The simulations of the scattering effects show that the fraction of scattered ions depends not only on the cone angle and shape of the hole, but also on the beam divergence and the gap between AFM tip and sample. The decrease in axial precision due to ion channeling depends mainly on the surface roughness and the incident angle of the ion beam. For a smooth (100) surface, a 12{$^\circ$}-inclined beam that provides the best conditions for highest resolution is found.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            2D materials can host long-range magnetic order in the presence of underlying magnetic anisotropy. The ability to realize the full potential of 2D magnets necessitates systematic investigation of the role of individual atomic layers and nanoscale inhomogeneity (i.e., strain) on the emergence of stable magnetic phases. Here, spatially dependent magnetism in few-layer CrSBr is revealed using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and Monte Carlo-based simulations. Nanoscale visualization of the magnetic sheet susceptibility is extracted from MFM data and force--distance curves, revealing a characteristic onset of both intra- and interlayer magnetic correlations as a function of temperature and layer-thickness. These results demonstrate that the presence of a single uncompensated layer in odd-layer terraces significantly reduces the stability of the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and gives rise to multiple coexisting magnetic ground states at temperatures close to the bulk N\'eel temperature (               T               N               ). Furthermore, the AFM phase can be reliably suppressed using modest fields ({$\approx$}16 mT) from the MFM probe, behaving as a nanoscale magnetic switch. This prototypical study of few-layer CrSBr demonstrates the critical role of layer parity on field-tunable 2D magnetism and validates MFM for use in nanomagnetometry of 2D materials (despite the ubiquitous absence of bulk zero-field magnetism in magnetized sheets).},

  abstract = {Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are atom-scale defects that can be used to sense magnetic fields with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Typically, the magnetic field is measured by averaging sequential measurements of single NV centers, or by spatial averaging over ensembles of many NV centers, which provides mean values that contain no nonlocal information about the relationship between two points separated in space or time. Here, we propose and implement a sensing modality whereby two or more NV centers are measured simultaneously, and we extract temporal and spatial correlations in their signals that would otherwise be inaccessible. We demonstrate measurements of correlated applied noise using spin-to-charge readout of two NV centers and implement a spectral reconstruction protocol for disentangling local and nonlocal noise sources.           ,              Covariance magnetometry                            Color defect centers in diamond, such as the nitrogen vacancy center effect, behave as miniature compass needles. Their optical signature is sensitive to local magnetic fields with nanoscale resolution. To date, these sensing modalities have been largely limited to detecting static magnetic fields or sensing an ensemble average, providing access to dynamical behavior only indirectly. Rovny               et al               . developed a theoretical framework and demonstrate a new sensing modality for detecting spatiotemporal correlations from simultaneous measurements of two nitrogen vacancy defect centers in diamond. Covariance measurements open a window for sensing spatiotemporal dynamics through nanoscale magnetometry. ---ISO                        ,              Simultaneous measurements of two nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond enables spatiotemporal magnetometry.},

Two reports now describe the use of near-surface nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects in diamond for detecting nanotesla magnetic fields from very small volumes of material (see the Perspective by                                Hemmer                              ).

We show pristine magnetic phases, devoid of defects on micron length-scales, and demonstrate remarkable air-stability down the monolayer limit. We furthermore address the spin-flip transition in bilayer CrSBr by imaging the phase-coexistence of regions of antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered and fully aligned spins. Our work will enable the engineering of exotic electronic and magnetic phases in CrSBr and the realization of novel nanomagnetic devices based on this highly promising vdW magnet.},

The resulting heterostructures had high electronic performance, with room-temperature carrier mobilities near the theoretical phonon-scattering limit.                        ,              Metal contacts to graphene along its edge improve bonding and, in turn, electronic performance.           ,              Heterostructures based on layering of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride represent a new class of electronic devices. Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary 2D materials.},

  abstract = {Strong interactions between particles can lead to emergent collective excitations. These phenomena have been extensively established in electronic systems, but are also expected to occur for gases of neutral particles like magnons, i.e. spin waves, in magnets. In a hydrodynamic regime where magnons are strongly interacting, they can form a slow collective density mode -- in analogy to sound waves in water -- with characteristic low-frequency signatures. While such a mode has been predicted in theory, its signatures have yet to be observed experimentally. In this work, we isolate exfoliated sheets of CrCl\$\_3\$ where magnon interactions are strong, and develop a technique to measure its collective magnon dynamics via the quantum coherence of nearby Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We find that the thermal magnetic fluctuations generated by monolayer CrCl\$\_3\$ exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence, whereby fluctuations increase upon decreasing temperature. Our analysis suggests that this anomalous trend is a consequence of the damping rate of a low-energy magnon sound mode which sharpens as magnon interactions increase with increasing temperature. By measuring the magnetic fluctuations emitted by thin multilayer CrCl\$\_\textbraceleft 3\textbraceright\$ in the presence of a variable-frequency drive field, we observe spectroscopic evidence for this two-dimensional magnon sound mode.},
